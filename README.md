# minecarts-plus

An addon for Minecraft BE that brings minecarts to their former glory.

## Background

As Minecraft has evolved over the years, so has the meta for transportation within the game. Modes involving horses, boats on ice, and elytra have all survived the test of time in one way or another, but many others have not been so lucky. The minecart is one such mode that has become more or less obsolete. Aside from how expensive railways are to build, minecarts are ridiculously slow, travelling slower than a car in a school zone... As such, there is little reason why a sane person would seriously consider transportation by rail today, especially in survival.

This addon hopes to change that, without introducing any new items, blocks, or entities. All that's involved is allowing a minecart's speed to be adjustible - from the single operating speed of 28.8km/h that we've known for over a decade, to a range between 0 and 108km/h. And with that, transportation by rail would once again become competitive, offering its own unique set of advantages.

## Installation

This is a behavio(u)r pack for Minecraft Bedrock Edition. For Minecraft Java Edition, consider Minecart Speed Plus or TrainCarts.

For most users, the `.mcpack` installation method is sufficient. To do this, convert the `Minecarts++` folder into a zip file, then rename the file extension to `.mcpack`. Then, double click the file and allow Minecraft BE to install the pack for you.

In some cases however, you may need to directly modify the files inside the addon. On Windows machines, behaviour packs are located in `C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\behavior_packs`, where you will find the files for all your behaviour packs.

Upon applying a pack to a world, a copy will be made of the pack and made specific to the world such that any global changes made to the pack later will not affect how the pack operates in the world. This may be reversed by deleting the pack copy in the world folder. These folders are located in `...\com.mojang\minecraftWorlds`.
