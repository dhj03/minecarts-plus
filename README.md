# minecarts-plus
An addon for Minecraft BE that brings minecarts to their former glory.

## Background
As Minecraft has evolved over the years, so has the meta for transportation within the game. Modes involving horses, boats on ice, and elytra have all survived the test of time in one way or another, but many others have not been so lucky. The minecart is one such mode that has become more or less obsolete. Aside from how expensive railways are to build, minecarts are ridiculously slow, travelling slower than a car in a school zone... As such, there is little reason why a sane person would seriously consider transportation by rail today, especially in survival.

This addon hopes to change that, without introducing any new items, blocks, or entities. All that's involved is allowing a minecart's speed to be adjustible - from the single operating speed of 28.8km/h that we've known for over a decade, to a range between 0 and 108km/h. And with that, transportation by rail would once again become competitive, offering its own unique set of advantages.

## Installation
This is a behavio(u)r pack for Minecraft Bedrock Edition. For Minecraft Java Edition, consider Minecart Speed Plus or TrainCarts.
